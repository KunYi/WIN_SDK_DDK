FEC_WIFE_ABLE   equ 0000000010000000b   ; can handle WIFE font as Engine font
FEC_EUDC_ABLE   equ 0000000100000000b   ; can handle EUDC in device font.

These two flags are mainly for printer driver.

If FEC_WIFE_ABLE is set, WIFE font is handles as same way as EngineRealized TrueType font. WIFE font can be realized by EngineRealizeFont DDI and can be printed by EngineGetGlyphBmp DDI.
Otherwise, WIFE font is handled as raster font, and WIFE font is printed via BitBlt.

If FEC_EUDC_ABLE is set, printer driver has to handle EUDC printing.
Otherwise EUDC is printed via BitBlt and printer driver doesn't have to take care of EUDC.
EUDC can be included in TrueType font and printer device font and these two type of EUDC has to be printed correctly.
