GAMEENUM consists of two components:
1. GAMEENUM.SYS, a game port enumerator
2. GAMEENUM.EXE, an application that communicates with the enumerator
via an ioctl interface.


GAMEENUM.SYS
------------

This code illustrates a sample WDM bus driver. The following files
are included:

gameenum.c     Routines for enumerating the bus
gameenum.h     Data structures for the bus
gameenum.rc    Resource script defining the type and placement of
               bus components
pnp.c          Plug-and-Play routines for bus driver

The behavior of the various routines is documented in code comments.


GAMEENUM.EXE
------------

This code illustrates a sample control panel simulator 
application. The following files are included:

game.h         Data structures
gameenum.rc    Resource script
locate.c       Routines
select.c       Routines

The behavior of the various routines is documented in code comments.
