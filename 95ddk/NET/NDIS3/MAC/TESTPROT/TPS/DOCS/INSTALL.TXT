1.1) Installing and Running the MAC Tester

	There are three files required to use the Ndis MAC Tester; TPDRVR.SYS,
TPCTL.EXE and TPDIFF.EXE.  The two executable files, TPCTL.EXE and
TPDIFF.EXE, simply need to reside on the environment path.  The driver
file, TPDRVR.SYS, should be place in the directory \nt\system\drivers.

	The NDIS MAC Tester driver requires an entry in the registry for
it to be loaded successfully.  To create this entry run the following
command:

	    REGINI TPDRVR.INI

    Where the file TPDRVR.INI contains the following:

        \Registry\Machine
    	    System
    		    CurrentControlSet
    			    Services
    				    Tpdrvr
    					    Type = REG_DWORD 0x00000001
    					    Start = REG_DWORD 0x00000002
        					Group = Extended base
        					ErrorControl = REG_DWORD 0x00000001

	Once the registry has been updated, and the files are in place reboot
their system.  The driver will now be installed and waiting for a command
from the control application.  To start the control application simply
type TPCTL at the command line.  This will return  a tester prompt,
[TPCTL:], from which test commands may be entered.  More information
on the commands may be found in the NDIS 3.0 MAC Tester Specification,
or by typing HELP at the tester prompt.
