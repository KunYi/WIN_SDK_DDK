                               DEBUG.TXT File
                               ==============

     This file contains instructions for setting up and running the
     Windows 95 DEBUG environment.


     DDKDEBUG.BAT
     ============
     DDKDEBUG.BAT is the batch file that is invoked to set/reset the
     desired environment. It accepts one of two parameters, SET or
     RESTORE. It must be invoked from the DDK\DEBUG directory.

        Setting up the DEBUG environment
        --------------------------------
        Type 'DDKDEBUG SET' from the DDK\DEBUG directory. This
        will copy the debug VxDs to the WIN\SYSTEM\VMM32 directory.

        Restoring the original environment
        ----------------------------------
        Type 'DDKDEBUG RESTORE' from the DDK\DEBUG directory. This
        will remove any VxDs previously copied to the 
        WIN\SYSTEM\VMM32 directory and leave any VxDs that were
        previously present in that directory.

        If WDEB386.EXE has been running as a VxD (see below), the
        'Device=WDEB386.EXE' and 'Device=DEBUGCMD.VXD' entries that 
        were added to the [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI should be 
        commented out (using a ';'). The other entries which were
        added need not be commented out as they will be ignored
        on subsequent loads of Windows 95.


     Running WDEB386.EXE
     ===================
     There are two ways in which WDEB386.EXE can be used to debug.
     
        Running WDEB386.EXE as a VxD
        ----------------------------
        DDKDEBUG.BAT will create a file called WDEBVXD.INS. The contents 
        of this file must be inserted into the [386Enh] section of 
        system.ini after it has been edited to contain the correct 
        debug settings. These settings are:

        DebugCom  - Number which represents COM port to which debug
                    terminal is attached. E.g. 'DebugCom=1'
        DebugBaud - Baud rate at which debug terminal will be
                    operating. E.g. 'DebugBaud=19200'
        DebugCmd  - Desired WDEB386 cmd line parameters. E.g adding /b 
                    to existing setting to break into debugger at 
                    SYS_CRITICAL_INIT. 'DebugCmd=y /n /b'

        Additional symbols can be loaded by inserting extra DebugSym
        entries. E.g. 'DebugSym=C:\FOO\MYSYMBOL.SYM'

        Running WDEB386 as a VxD requires approximately 90KB less 
        of conventional memory than running from the command line. 
        Its only disadvantage is that loaded symbols aren't available 
        until after SYS_CRITICAL_INIT.

        Once all settings are verified and WDEBVXD.INS has been
        inserted into the [386Enh] section of system.ini, run 'WIN'
        from the WINDOWS directory.
      
        Running WDEB386.EXE from the command line
        -----------------------------------------
        DDKDEBUG.BAT will create a file called RUNWDEB.WRF. This file
        along with RUNWDEB.BAT will be copied to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM
        directory (provided that files with these names are not already
        present in that directory).

        WINDOWS\SYSTEM\RUNWDEB.BAT should be edited to contain the 
        correct debug settings. These settings are:

        /c: - Number which represents COM port to which debug terminal 
              is attached. E.g. '/c:1'
        /r: - Baud rate at which debug terminal will be operating. 
              E.g. '/r:19200'

        Any additional desired command line options can be added to 
        this file. 

        WINDOWS\SYSTEM\RUNWDEB.WRF should be editing to contain any
        additional symbol files which may be needed. 
        E.g. '/s:C:\FOO\MYSYMBOL.SYM'

        Once all settings are verified Windows 95 can be loaded by
        running RUNWDEB.BAT (with one optional WDEB386 command line
        parameter) from the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.
