 To build VxDs with this version of the DDK it is necessary to pick up
  some updates for your tools.  Here are the steps:

   1.  Copy linker files (link.*) from the \DDK\MSVC20 directory to your
   MSVC20\BIN directory. This is an updated version of the MSVC20 linker
   which  includes special enhancements for building VxDs. This linker will
   replace LINK386.EXE.

   2.  Copy the contents of the MASM611C directory into your MASM6x\BIN
   directory.  These fixes will be included in the next release of MASM 6.X.

If you have not built VxDs with the new linker yet, consult \DDK\BASE\VC2CONV.TXT
for instructions on modifying your make files.
