1. Start a "Run in Real Mode" DOS command prompt
after reading the steps below.
2. Install EMM386.exe by adding the following line
to config.sys after the device=himem.sys line.
       device=c:\windows\EMM386.exe RAM
Note that this example assumes that your Windows 95
directory is C:\WINDOWS.  If you have EMM386
loaded as NOEMS, please change it to
RAM as above, or leave blank which
will default to EMS.

3. Reboot your system.
4. Run Windows 95 and the start the
Windows 95 SCT.
}(
emm386.2=1. An MS-DOS Prompt will be

marked passed, please drag the test icon
from the right side of the test shell to 
the waste basket.  Then mark the test as
failed and note in the comments section
what happened.  Please press continue.
}(
emm386.4=
If you wish you may de-install emm386.exe after
completing this test by removing the
 device= EMM386.exe RAM
line from config.sys and rebooting your system.
}(


xms.1=When you press continue a Single MS-DOS app
test will run. When it is finished  you will return
to Windows 95 and the SCT automatically. Re-run this
test at that time to automatically record a result.
}(


xms.old=If you have followed these directions
previously then please select
Continue.  Otherwise, Start a "Run in Real Mode"
DOS command  prompt and go to the SCT Directory.
Execute the XMSRUN batch file.  When
this program has completed it's
execution, return to the Windows SCT.
}(


DosMouse.1=You do not have an MS-DOS mouse driver
installed, so this test can not run
to completion.

Please install this driver by performing the
following steps:

1. Start a "Run in Real Mode" DOS command prompt
 after reading the directions below.

2. Install a mouse driver. The MS-Mouse driver
   is installed by either
   a. running mouse.com
     or
   b.
    adding a line such as
    DEVICE=[PATH]MOUSE.SYS /Y
    to your config.sys where [PATH] is
    the full DOS path to your Windows
    directory. Then rebooting your
    system.

3. Run Windows and start the
Windows SCT.
}(

DosMouse.2=Start an MS-DOS Prompt.

 Run the Edit application from the DOS Prompt
   by typing Edit.
}(
dosmouse.3=
 Alt-Tab between the DOS Prompt and a
 Windows application,  (Tray, or
 other) and verify that the mouse
 continues to work correctly in both.

Note: Be sure to use the mouse buttons,
and move the mouse in both the DOS Prompt
and in the Windows application.  Watch
for the mouse freezing, buttons which
failing to respond, sluggish response,
multiple cursors, or any other incorrect
response from the mouse.

WinMouse.2=In the Properties for Mouse, 
select the Buttons tab.  Increase
or decrease the mouse setting for Double-
Click Speed, then click Apply Now to make
the change.  Verify that the mouse double
click speed has responded correctly.
This can be verified by double clicking
on the Test Box to select it.  Choose it
by double clicking slower or faster.

Repeat this with several different speed
settings, both increased and decreased to
verify that the double click speed setting
responds correctly.

Note: When the Double Click Speed is at
the maximum speed it may be very difficult
to click the mouse fast enough to trigger
a Click Signal.  This is not a bug.
}(

WinMouse.3=In the Properties for Mouse
in the same Buttons tab area, swap the
mouse Button Configuration, so that the left
button acts as the right button and vice
versa. With the left button, select the
Left-handed button.  Note:
you must use right button now to verify 
this change.  Next use right button to 
select Right-handed button to return 
mouse control to Right-handed button.  

Return settings back to original settings
and close the Properties for Mouse 
by pressing OK button.

coproc.1=Multiple Use of Coprocessor Test
This test will launch two copies of the
MathTest.Exe and one copy of the
WinMath.Exe test.  When these have
been started, use Alt+Esc to switch
between them several times during
their run. To start select Continue.

If you have no coprocessor present in
the system all three applications will
detect this and will not run.

When the test has completed then you
must enter "No coprocessor in machine"
in the Comments section of the test
evaluation dialog and choose Disable.

}(

coproc.2=When the third application has
begun, begin Alt+Esc between them.
When all have completed
(or if no coprocessor is present),
select Continue.

}(


coproc.3=  Please verify that the DOS
VMs and the Windows application have
completed running and are closed. To close
the applications press a key.

When they are all closed select Continue.

dispalt1.0=The shell has Disptest listed
as having been passed, or having been not
run yet.  This test is only necessary if
Disptest has failed or has been disabled.
Press Continue to exit the test.
}(

dispalt1.1=The test statistics show Disptest
to have failed, or to be disabled.  You may
perform one of the following:
1.  Abort this test, and attempt to rerun
    the Disptest test to change its status.

2.  Press the continue button which will
    launch another variation of Disptest with
    automated clipboard verification.
    Complete this test following the
    directions for disptest.

We suggest that if you fail the first Disptest
variation, you should attempt to rerun that
variation at least once before trying this
variation.

Please choose either abort or continue.
}(


dispalt1.2=Please choose continue when you
have completed running this variation of
Disptest.  Do not choose continue until
Disptest has been terminated.
}(

dispalt2.0=The shell has Disptest listed
as having been passed, or having been not
run yet.  Or Disptest has been listed as
failed or disabled and the first alternate
test has been passed or not run.  This
test is only necessary if both Disptest
and the first alternate test have failed
or have been disabled.
Press Continue to exit the test.
}(

dispalt2.1=The test statistics show that
both Disptest and DispAlt1 have failed,
or been disabled.  You may perform one

    the Disptest or DispAlt1 test to change
    it's status.

2.  Press the continue button which will
    launch another variation of Disptest,
    which relies on manual verification
    of the clipboard and complete this
    test following the directions for
    disptest.

This version of Disptest relies on the tester
to perform many additional steps, so we
recommend, you try to pass using one of
the other variations, before attempting
this one.

Please choose either abort or continue.
}(

dispalt2.2=Please choose continue when you
have completed running this variation of
Disptest.  Do not choose continue until
Disptest has been terminated.

Please pay special attention to the
clipboard data.  This test relies solely
on the judgment of the user for verifying
the integrity of that data.
If a discrepancy is found, please note
down the screen number as well as the
position of the screen in the order they
are displayed.
Ex: xxxxxxxx  nn/oo
 xxxxxxxx   8 digit screen number

  6. When you have done step 5 several times
    close the DOS Box by typing "Exit".

  Press Continue, when you are done.
}(

stnddisp.1= Pressing the continue button will
launch a variation of Disptest, which relies
on manual verification of the clipboard.

This version of Disptest relies on the tester
to perform many additional steps not necessary
in the Enhanced Mode version.  Please pay
special attention to the instructions for
Prnt-Scrn verification.

Please choose either abort or continue.
}(


vmkeyalt.0=The shell has the VMKeyState test
listed as having been passed, or having
been not run yet.  This test is only
necessary if VMKeyState failed or has been
disabled.

Press Continue to exit the test.
}(

vmkeyalt.1=The test statistics show the VMKeyState
test as having failed, or been disabled.  You
may perform one of the following:

1.  Abort this test, and attempt to rerun
    VMKeyState to change it's status.

2.  Press the continue button which will
    display some instructions to follow to
    manually test the Virtual Keyboard
    functionality.

you should attempt to rerun that
test at least once before trying this
manual version of the test.

Please choose either abort or continue.
}(


vmkeyalt.2=This test is now launching two DOS
boxes and running a copy of WordPad.  If
these fail to open you may have two little
memory available and may need to perform
this test without the aid of this script.
If this is the case, please press abort and
close the DOS boxes which did start and
WordPad, if it successfully started.

Then exit the SCT and run two DOS boxes and
WordPad, then run the steps listed by the
script.  When done rerun this test and
press continue till you reach the evaluation
box, and comment on the test steps you
performed.  After this, you will once again
have to close the DOS Boxes and WordPad.
}(

vmkeyalt.3=Turn on each of the state keys,
(Scroll Lock, Caps Lock and Num Lock), one
at a time, two at time, and all three at
once with every combination possible.
First in WordPad and then in one of the
DOS boxes.
}(

vmkeyalt.4=Turn at least one of the statekeys
on in WordPad, (light on keyboard will
be on.)  Alt Tab to one of the DOS boxes
and hit a state key that is turned on
twice and verify that the state is the
same as it was when you entered the DOS
box.  (ie. the num lock is on when you
start then you hit that key twice and
it should be on when you are done.)

After this has been performed try this
with a statekey that was initially off.
Also try this with different starting
and ending points.  (ie.  Start in a
DOS box and switch to WordPad, or
start in one DOS box and switch to the
other.)

This should be verified for all
combinations of state keys and all
combinations of DOS boxes and WordPad.

}(

vmkeyalt.5=At this point you can switch
between DOS boxes and WordPad and press
different statekeys and take note of
any peculiar reactions. (ie.  It took
two presses to change the keystate, or
typing in WordPad is lowercase even though
the Caps Lock light it on.)

When you are done, proceed to the
evaluation box and note any problems
that occurred with this test.
}(

CDAudio.1=Please ensure that the DDK CDROM
is in your CDROM Drive.
}(

CDAudio.2=Insert headphones into the jack provided on your
CDROM Drive. You will hear a sound and then choose
that sound from a list which will be presented. At
times a separate MS-DOS test will run, you can just
ignore the MS-DOS test and wait for the next sound.
