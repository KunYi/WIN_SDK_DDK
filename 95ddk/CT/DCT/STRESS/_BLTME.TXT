About the _BLTME stress test:

_BLTME is a test application which tests the BibBlt() and StretchBlt() APIs.

_BLTME is controlled by two .INI settings which live in the STRESSME.INI file
under the [StressMe._BLTME] section. These settings are:

  [StressMe._BltMe]
  ; *** Put the path to your bitmap collection here ***
  Bitmaps=
  ; *** List the types of files you want to process here ***
  ; *** file specifications are separated by comas (,).  ***
  FilesToDo=*.RLE,*.DIB,*.BMP

_BLTME looks at all of the files in the *Bitmaps* variable which match the
*FilesToDo* variable. It creates a list of all the files it finds which match
these criteria.

_BLTME creates a Device Dependent Bitmap (DDB) from the file stored on disk
using CreateDIBitmap(). The following tests are then performed:

   Operation      SOURCE DC   DESTINATION DC
   BitBlt()       Memory      Screen
   BitBlt()       Memory      Memory
   StretchBlt()   Memory      Screen
   StretchBlt()   Memory      Memory

To install the _BLTME test application, follow these steps:
   1) copy STRESSME.INI to your Chicago directory
   2) copy LOG32.DLL to your Chicago directory
   3) copy _BLTME.EXE to a directory somewhere on your local hard drive.
   4) run _BLTME.EXE

_BLTME will run forever (unless it finds a GP fault!!!) or until you stop it.
Selecting "Close" from its system menu will do that. _BLTME creates a .LOG file
called _BLTME.LOG in it's working directory. The logfile will look something
like this:

  [MsgWindow] [Processing file: \\chicagui\bitmaps\BLACKDOG.BMP]
  [LogWrite] [Test mode:     BitBlt(): MEMORY_TO_SCREEN]
  [LogWrite] [Test mode: StretchBlt(): MEMORY_TO_SCREEN]
  [LogWrite] [Test mode:     BitBlt(): MEMORY_TO_MEMORY]
  [LogWrite] [Test mode: StretchBlt(): MEMORY_TO_MEMORY]
  [MsgWindow] [Processing file: \\chicagui\bitmaps\DOGFACE2.BMP]
  [LogWrite] [Test mode:     BitBlt(): MEMORY_TO_SCREEN]
  [LogWrite] [Test mode: StretchBlt(): MEMORY_TO_SCREEN]
  [LogWrite] [Test mode:     BitBlt(): MEMORY_TO_MEMORY]
  [LogWrite] [Test mode: StretchBlt(): MEMORY_TO_MEMORY]
  [MsgWindow] [Processing file: \\chicagui\bitmaps\SUNSET.BMP]
  [LogWrite] [Test mode:     BitBlt(): MEMORY_TO_SCREEN]
  [LogWrite] [Test mode: StretchBlt(): MEMORY_TO_SCREEN]
  [LogWrite] [Test mode:     BitBlt(): MEMORY_TO_MEMORY]
  [UploadResults] [Vars [  11], Att [  11], Pass [  11], Fail [   0],
                  Att% [100], Pass% [100]]

The [UploadResults] line contains interesting information regarding how many
variations were attempted, and how many of those passed and failed.
