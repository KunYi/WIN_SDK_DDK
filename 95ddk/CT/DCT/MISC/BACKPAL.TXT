===========================================
* This test is only applicable to 256 color display modes.  Backpal will
notify you should you attempt to run it at other color depths.

* You only need to run this test at one resolution (so long as you are
using 256 color mode).

* You should run this test using all 4 settings of the Graphics Performance
slider.  The slider can be set from My Computer.Properties, performance
tab, graphics button.

* If only the first object (cube with square corners) changes colors, then
you most likely have a bug in your driver's patblt code.
