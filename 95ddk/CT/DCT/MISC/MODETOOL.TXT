                       MODETOOL.EXE - quick docs  1/23/95



ModeTool will allow you to quickly verify that you can change to different
display modes and optionally run a test at each display mode.  ModeTool is
able to restart your system when a color depth change is required.


Checkboxes:
===========================================

Run Test?
------------------------------
if checked, the test specified in the edit control will be executed. This
test can be a batch file.  If you do run batch files, you might want to 
change _DEFAULT.PIF in your WINDOWS dir so that dos windows close on exit 
by default.


Pause for user messages?
------------------------------
if checked, then user msgs will be displayed such as the following:
   * Before reboot confirmation
   * Information if mode change was successful
   * Chance to abort if a mode fails (otherwise next mode is tested)


MODE VERIFICATION RUN
===========================================

1. run modetool from a read/write directory.
Modetool will call EnumDisplaySettings and fill the list box with all modes
supposidly supported by the current display adapter.

2. select modes you want to test.

3. select Go! button to execute selected modes.



SETTINGS FILE
===========================================
ModeTool can read the following information from a settings file for total 
automation.  The settings file is specified on the command line.  If a path 
to the settings file is omitted, ModeTool will look for the settings file 
in the same dir as the exe.


The settings file is an INI file (any extension can be used).  The settings 
file may contain the following information:

// modetool filename.ext
//
//
// Is in INI format with one section: [Settings] with the following keys:
//
// [Settings]
// run=
// modes=
// pause=
// DCTSmoke=
//
//
// SWITCH DESCRIPTION:
// ---------------------------------------------------------------
// run: the entire command line for what you want executed.
//      DEFAULT: no test will be run
//
// modes: defaults to all supported modes.  You can also specify the
// following values:
//    all         run all supported modes (default value)
//    xx          run all modes at xx bpp only (like 4 or 8 or 16 etc.)
//    res         run all resolutions at current bpp (no reboot)
//
// pause: if nonzero then pause (show prompts, msg boxes).  The default
//        is to enable pause.
//
// DCTSmoke: if nonzero, then run DCTSmoke if installed.
// 




NOTES:
===========================================
* ModeTool logs information to a log file in the same dir as the exe file.

* ModeTool will start a new log file for each test run and rename the old
log file as ModeTool.000, 001, 002, etc..

* If you are running wdeb386 debugger, ModeTool will echo log information
to the debugger.

* Since ModeTool might restart your system, you should setup your system to
boot into Win95 automatically.

* ModeTool disables the network login dlg for automation if it needs to 
restart your system. It enables the login dlg after it runs each time.

* When the system is restarted, you are given 10 seconds to abort the test 
run.
