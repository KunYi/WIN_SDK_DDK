NAME OF TEST: ROP2 Test


TEST COVERAGE:
The ROP2 test exercises the Display Driver's Binary Raster Operation (ROP2)
code.  The test covers Blt-ing the major GDI primitives using each of the
Binary ROPs.


TEST OPERATION:
The ROP2 test uses DTA.EXE to draw GDI primitives using the standard brush
styles (i.e.  Solid, Horizontal, NULL, etc) and all of the Binary Raster
Operations in both Opaque and Transparent blackground modes.  The results
of drawing each primitive to a S reen DC and a DDB are compared
pixel-by-pixel.

In STRESS mode, the following primitives are tested: Rectangle, Round Rect,
Ellipse, Arc, Chord, Pie, LineTo, Polyline and Polygon.

There is are no SMOKE or VERIFY modes for this test.


FAILURE INFORMATION:
A typical failure in the ROP2 test indicates that the Display Driver Blt-ed
incorrectly.  To reproduce the failure, follow the steps listed below
substituting the specific details found in the log file.


REPRO STEPS
1.  Launch DTA.EXE
2.  From the Options menu, select Points...
3.  Uncheck the check boxes for Random Principal Points
4.  Set the Coordinates as follows:
    (X1,Y1) = (10,10)
    (X2,Y2) = (180,120)
    (X3,Y3) = (100,50)
    (X4,Y4) = (50,100)
5.  Click Ok
6.  From the Options menu, select Misc...
7.  Set the DIBSection BPP to "Screen DC"
8.  Set the ROP2 to the appropriate ROP from the log file
9.  Set the Background Mode to the Mode specified in the log
10. Click Ok
11. From the Options menu, select Primitive...
12. Deselect all primitives and select the Primitive specified in the log
13. Click Ok
14. From the Options menu, select Brush...
15. Selct the Style shown in the log
16. Click Ok
17. Press F3 to draw the primitive
18. Repeat Steps 6 - 17 changing the DIBSection BPP to "Use DDB"
19. Compare the Screen DC and Use DDB images to find the error.


SAMPLE LOG DATA:

The following is an excerpt from DCT.LOG showing a failure case in the ROP2
test.  In the example, the Pie primative is not being drawn correctly when
the background mode is set to Opaque, using a Vertical brush and the
R2_WHITE ROP.  Primitive : Backgnd Mode : Brush : ROP2

---------------------------------------------------------------
Pie       : Opaque       : Vertical     : R2_WHITE --==>> FAIL!
