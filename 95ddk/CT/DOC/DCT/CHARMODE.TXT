NAME OF TEST: Character Mode Test


TEST COVERAGE:
The Character Mode test exercises the VDD/MiniVDD by running an MS-DOS VM,
and toggling it's state (full screen <-> windowed).  During the course of
this test, the major character modes will be envoked using the MS-DOS MODE
command to verify correct han ing by the VDD/MiniVDD.


TEST OPERATION:
The Character Mode test executes the MS-DOS MODE command ...  toggling the
VM state repeatedly between windowed and full screen.

In STRESS mode, this test repeats 200 times.

There is no VERIFY mode for this test.


FAILURE INFORMATION:
Failures will typically be faults in the MiniVDD and/or main VDD.  To
analyze where the fault occured, consult the MODETEST.LOG file found in the
CTLOGS subdirectory (located in your WINDOWS directory).

The log file provides information on the last mode tested and whether or
not a transiton has occured.  The MODETEST.LOG file does not indicate when
a transition has occured.  On completion of the test, MODETEST.LOG is
updated to indictate that the test s finished.

To reproduce a failure case, launch an MS-DOS Propmt, issue the last MODE
command (i.e.  "MODE CON:LINES=50"), scroll some text on the screen, and
use ALT+ENTER to toggle to and from Full Screen mode.

SAMPLE LOG DATA:
The following sample from the MODETEST.LOG file shows a PASS case:
